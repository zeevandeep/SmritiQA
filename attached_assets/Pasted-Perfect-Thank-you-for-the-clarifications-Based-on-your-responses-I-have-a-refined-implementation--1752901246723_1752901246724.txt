Perfect! Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your responses, I have a refined implementation plan. Let me ask a few final clarifying questions to ensure the implementation is exactly what you need:

Refined Implementation Plan Summary
Based on your answers:

✅ Only encrypt new nodes going forward (no migration of existing nodes)
✅ Edge processing won't need decrypted text access
✅ Accept slight performance overhead for reflection generation
✅ Support both encrypted and unencrypted nodes during transition
✅ Use same error handling pattern as sessions (migration_errors table)
Final Clarifying Questions:
1. New Node Creation Behavior:
When creating new nodes, should encryption be:

Option A: Always enabled by default for all new nodes
Option B: Configurable via environment variable (e.g., ENCRYPT_NEW_NODES=true/false)
Option C: User-specific setting (some users get encrypted nodes, others don't)
2. API Response Handling:
For API endpoints that return node data, should we:

Option A: Always return decrypted text when user requests their own nodes
Option B: Add an optional parameter to API endpoints for requesting decrypted vs encrypted data
Option C: Never expose encrypted text through APIs (always decrypt for user-facing responses)
3. Reflection Generation Service:
Should the reflection service:

Option A: Always decrypt all nodes in a chain (both old unencrypted and new encrypted ones)
Option B: Only decrypt encrypted nodes, leave unencrypted nodes as-is
Option C: Detect encryption status and handle each node appropriately
4. Testing Strategy:
Should I include:

Option A: Unit tests for encryption/decryption of node text
Option B: Integration tests for mixed encrypted/unencrypted node scenarios
Option C: Both unit and integration tests
Option D: Minimal testing (just verify basic functionality works)
5. Environment Variable Requirements:
The current session encryption uses MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY and STATIC_ENCRYPTION_SALT. Should node encryption:

Option A: Use the same environment variables (shared encryption system)
Option B: Use separate node-specific environment variables
Option C: Use the same variables but with a different salt derivation method
These answers will help me create the exact implementation you want without any assumptions.
